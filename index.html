                          This is one of my proudest projects. Having gone through Rocket Academy, I had the confidence in myself to try develop my version of a simple Zoom. I spent about 5 days reading documentations and running small tests before finally deciding I could get this done by due date. Although there were plenty of react libraries for video applications, I chose to dig in myself and worked with the Web API's MediaDevices to get the each user's stream. Good choice I must say, as it gave me the opportunity to pick up new technologies while understanding them myself. 
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="light-text">Challenges faced</h2>
                        <p class="light-text">Obviously there were many challenges/blockers I faced while developing this web app, but I think the most interesting one was figuring out how to host a group video call. Handling a 1-to-1 was quite straight forward as all I had to do was get one user to send a request and handle the anwsering logic on the other end. But with many other users doing the same thing I got overwhelmed by the idea ðŸ¤¯ Turns out it was quite straight forward! I made it so that in a group of let's say 3 (person "A", "B" and "C"), the first person (presumably the host whom we'll call "A"), would only have to care about sending out the call request. The other two users, "B" and "C" would each receive a call request from the host (person "A") and the recieving logic would run on their end respectively. So this means now, on each person's screen, A would see both "B" and "C", while both "B" and "C" only has "A" on their screens. Now we can assume that "B" is the second person to join the room. The same logic would apply for "B" in terms of making the call request to "C". But we're not done here! Any user who isn't the first person to join the room would have to handle TWO events. Calling and receiving. Calling any new user who joins the room and receiving call requests from users before them. This is (in short detail) how i overcame this particular challenge for this project! I hope to write a longer blog on this topic when time permits! Stay tuned! ðŸ¤“</p>
                        <h2 class="light-text">Take Aways</h2>
                        <p class="light-text">My biggest take away from this project was definitely to really understand the technologies we choose to use for our projects. I spent a few days just reading documentations and running tests on a seperate environment before starting actual work. Initially I felt like i was behind time (we were given 2 weeks to complete our projects), but i found that with better knowledge in the tech we use (Obviously  ðŸ¤¨) i was able to pick up pace with development and pull through and meet datelines!</p>

                          This is one of my proudest projects. Having gone through Rocket Academy, I had the confidence in myself to try develop my version of a simple Zoom. I spent about 5 days reading documentations and running small tests before finally deciding I could get this done by due date. Although there were plenty of react libraries for video applications, I chose to dig in myself and worked with the Web API's MediaDevices to get the each user's stream. Good choice I must say, as it gave me the opportunity to pick up new technologies while understanding them myself. 
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="light-text">Challenges faced</h2>
                        <p class="light-text">Obviously there were many challenges/blockers I faced while developing this web app, but I think the most interesting one was figuring out how to host a group video call. Handling a 1-to-1 was quite straight forward as all I had to do was get one user to send a request and handle the anwsering logic on the other end. But with many other users doing the same thing I got overwhelmed by the idea ðŸ¤¯ Turns out it was quite straight forward! I made it so that in a group of let's say 3 (person "A", "B" and "C"), the first person (presumably the host whom we'll call "A"), would only have to care about sending out the call request. The other two users, "B" and "C" would each receive a call request from the host (person "A") and the recieving logic would run on their end respectively. So this means now, on each person's screen, A would see both "B" and "C", while both "B" and "C" only has "A" on their screens. Now we can assume that "B" is the second person to join the room. The same logic would apply for "B" in terms of making the call request to "C". But we're not done here! Any user who isn't the first person to join the room would have to handle TWO events. Calling and receiving. Calling any new user who joins the room and receiving call requests from users before them. This is (in short detail) how i overcame this particular challenge for this project! I hope to write a longer blog on this topic when time permits! Stay tuned! ðŸ¤“</p>
